# refl-cpp [WIP]
A more simple reflection library for `C++`.
With a hands-off approach.
Only one macro to mark the `class/struct` to be reflected.

## TODO
- [critical] add code generator
- [critical] add easy build hook for projects
- support template parameters
- check if `Variant` and `Result` don't copy things that are not intended

## Dependencies
these are getting managed through [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake)

- ccache.cmake
- LLVM / Clang
